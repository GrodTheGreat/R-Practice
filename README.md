### Tips for Progression:

- **Practice Regularly:** Consistency is key in learning programming. Try to code a little bit every day.
- **Read Documentation:** Familiarize yourself with the official documentation of Python and the libraries you use.
- **Join Communities:** Participate in forums like Stack Overflow, Reddit, or Python-specific communities to ask questions and share knowledge.
- **Explore Further:** Once youâ€™re comfortable with the basics, start exploring more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, unit testing, or more complex web development with Django.
